The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m.    at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield.    The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said.    The extent of their injuries was not immediately known.    The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said.    The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said.    The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter.    The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs.    Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew.    In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.    A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002.    The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006.

The opening was low and narrow.    A few saplings bound together with strips of rawhide closed it against stray beasts.    Bukawai removed the primitive door and pushed Tibo within.    The hyenas, snarling, rushed past him and were lost to view in the blackness of the interior.    Bukawai replaced the saplings and seizing Tibo roughly by the arm, dragged him along a narrow, rocky passage.    The floor was comparatively smooth, for the dirt which lay thick upon it had been trodden and tramped by many feet until few inequalities remained.    The passage was tortuous, and as it was very dark and the walls rough and rocky, Tibo was scratched and bruised from the many bumps he received.    Bukawai walked as rapidly through the winding gallery as one would traverse a familiar lane by daylight.    He knew every twist and turn as a mother knows the face of her child, and he seemed to be in a hurry.    He jerked poor little Tibo possibly a trifle more ruthlessly than necessary even at the pace Bukawai set; but the old witch-doctor, an outcast from the society of man, diseased, shunned, hated, feared, was far from possessing an angelic temper.    Nature had given him few of the kindlier characteristics of man, and these few Fate had eradicated entirely.    Shrewd, cunning, cruel, vindictive, was Bukawai, the witch-doctor. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

That means gravity affects all objects in the universe.    Thats why his law of gravity is called the law of universal gravitation.    Universal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way.    This is the reason the apple falling from the tree and the Moon being held in orbit is the same.    Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull on you, you exert a pull on Earth.    In fact, there is gravity between you and every mass around you.    Even tiny molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity.    Newtons law had a huge impact on how people thought about the universe.

One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it \"his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir.\"    The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it.    The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection.    Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement.    Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse.    The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis.    Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry.    Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him.    Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven.

Until then he had been a petted child in a wealthy family.    Mr. Allan did not have that affection for him which Mrs. Allan had.    He did not understand the boy's peculiar and erratic nature, and was particularly displeased when he found that Edgar had run into debt at college.    There was an angry scene between the two, and Edgar was told that he must leave the university and go into the counting-room.    It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune.    He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry.    In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen.    Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were.    While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them.    This gentleman advised against it on the ground that it would make Edgar conceited,--a fault from which he was already suffering.    As soon as he was free to do as he pleased, therefore, it was natural that he should rewrite his poems and publish them. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

Robert Menendez.    With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans.    Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January.    \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock.    That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for.    Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over.    Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments.    Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities.    \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said.    The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.    The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation.    And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez.    While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it.    This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.    A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander.    The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance.    Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.    Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages.    His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.    Callisthenes had fallen out of favor by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts.    Starting from Amphipolis, he traveled east into the country of the \"Independent Thracians\"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights.    The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube).    Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore.    Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish.    News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulanti were in open revolt against his authority.    Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops.    With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.    While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again.    Alexander immediately headed south.    While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight.    The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities.    The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.    Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs.    It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations.    Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations.    The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble.    The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union.    They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN.    One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building.    The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN.    Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said.

{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Was the Bobo Doll experiment used to develop social learning theory? \nContent: Albert Bandura OC (/baen'dU@r@/; born December 4, 1925) is a psychologist who is the David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science in Psychology at Stanford University.    For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology.    He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment.    Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others.    An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher.    Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\"    To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action.    The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children.    A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one.    Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time.    In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA).    He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48.    Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.    At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

Legal Services of Southern Missouri (LSSM) serves 43 counties in this area and is dedicated to ensuring all people, regardless of their income, equal access to legal advice and counsel.    Out of the 43 counties in the LSSM service region, Butler County has the fifth highest number of cases served in 2001 and the third largest number of attorney panel members.    \"The Butler County attorneys have really stepped up to the plate to help us represent the poor population in this county,\" said LSSM Director of Development Sharon Alexander.    \"We had approximately 400 cases in Butler County last year.\"    LSSM is funded by the Legal Services Corporation (LSC)- a private, not-for-profit organization.    Created by Congress, LSSM also receives funding from the Missouri Lawyer Trust Account Foundation and local area agencies on aging.    But LSSM credits the attorneys that volunteer their time and skills to representing the underprivileged and elderly for the success of the organization.    Currently, LSSM utilizes the services of 243 private attorneys who provide a minimum of 20 hours of pro bono or two pro bono cases per year.    \"Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is provide equal access to justice, for all people - regardless of their economic standing,\" said LSSM Board Member and volunteer attorney, Fred Hall.    \"If a husband knocks his wife down, breaks her jaw or arm - abuses her terribly - he will be picked up and put in jail.    But he's entitled to have a public defender ... Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\"    LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients.    Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters.    Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials.    \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said.    \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.

Smith has helped senior citizens with their legal needs, free of charge.    But Smith, like many volunteers, doesn't want any accolades.    \"I'm no saint,\" the 80-year-old Tallahasseean said.    \"I'm just a country lawyer.\"    His assistant, attorney Twyla Sketchley, sat behind his shoulder and silently mouthed, \"He is a saint.\"    Every month, Smith visits the Smith Williams Center in the Bond community and the Wakulla County Senior Citizens Council building in Crawfordville to advise seniors on wills, power of attorney and other legal matters.    Smith practiced law for a living until 1982.    Since then, he's been semi-retired, devoting himself to helping fellow seniors who are needy.    \"I'm getting unable to do much physically, but my brain hasn't quit,\" said Smith, who walks with a cane.    \"And I'd rather people ask a foolish question now than have them make a dumb mistake later.\"    Smith and Sketchley helped Beatrice Jackson at the Smith Williams Center on Wednesday.    Jackson, who said she was \"over 60,\" needed help with estate planning.    \"He's not through with me yet ... but he's done a real good job,\" said Jackson, a retired state worker.

Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development.    Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration.    Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society.    Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland.    These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia.    They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising.

On his arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the FBI.    In February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues.    He reported that at the time, the attorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve,\" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation.    Neither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief.    His office did receive the daily intelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same threat information.    The FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy called MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000.    The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, Dale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy.    Watson had the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and civil rights.    The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since fiscal year 1997.    The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident response capability.    In May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that would usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002.    On May 9, the attorney general testified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism.    He said that \"one of the nation's most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks.\"    The budget guidance issued the next day, however, highlighted gun crimes, narcotics trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

You're with ME.\" Distinctly annoyed, slightly bewildered, the banker sank between the arms of a chair.    He felt he had lost his individuality.    Andrews had become his sponsor.    Because of Andrews he was tolerated.    Because Andrews had a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among police-court lawyers.    No longer was he Arnold Thorndike.    He was merely the man \"with Mr. Andrews.\" Then even Andrews abandoned him.    \"The judge'll be here in a minute, now,\" said the assistant district attorney, and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judge's bench.    There he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of Mr. Andrews.    Seated on the rail, with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr. Thorndike, they laughed and talked together.    The subject of their discourse was one Mike Donlin, as he appeared in vaudeville.    To Mr. Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely forgotten him.    He arose, and touched his sleeve.    With infinite sarcasm Mr. Thorndike began: \"My engagements are not pressing, but\u2014\" A court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail.    \"Sit down!\" whispered Andrews.    \"The judge is coming.\" Mr. Thorndike sat down.

He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan.    In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands.    Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in  Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996.    In ensuing weeks,  Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\"    By this time,  Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.    Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons.    Some of  Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates.    For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with  Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan.    The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom  Bin Laden admired, was also in the network.    Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan.    There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to  Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates.    In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years.    Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections.    And in this network,  Bin Laden's agenda stood out.    While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya,  Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States.    After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction.    In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film.    But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \"gun rights\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish.    Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people?    I highly doubt it.    But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK.

You write: \"Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before\".    This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against.    It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset.    The kid was a little bastard, and the parents were involved in drugs -- case closed.    But why do people deal with drugs?    Because it's so much fun to do so?

The first climate zone is the polar zone.    As it sounds, the polar zone is near earths poles.    The polar zone has very long and cold winters.    Brrr!!!!    Near the equator is the tropical zone.    The tropical zone is known for being hot and wet.    Between these two zones is the temperate zone.    Temperatures there tend to be mild.    Its not too hot and not too cold.    You might expect places near the equator to be hot and wet.    Thats not always the case.    Sometimes there are other factors at work.    These factors can affect the local climate type or a region.    Oceans and mountain ranges can have a major impact.    They can greatly influence the climate of an area.

He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood.    Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max.    Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase.    They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek.    They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water.    One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him.    Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest.    Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend.    After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed.    He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy.    Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle.    The dogs were having so much fun.    Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back.    Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend.    All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

There are many ways in which living organisms can affect their ecosystem.    In some areas, it is because of fire management.    Fire is a natural event, so managing fire correctly is very important.    In other areas, fisherman have taken too many fish from one area.    This places the species at risk of extinction.    It also affects other living things that may rely on these fish for food.    The image below shows a picture of a mine.    Mining changes the Earths surface.    This area may once have been a forest or a prairie.    Think about how many plants and animals may once have lived here.    Now it is a giant hole in the ground.

{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Is Clarke's staff part of the Justice Department? \nContent: After the disruption of the plot in Amman, it had not escaped notice in Washington that Hijazi had lived in California and driven a cab in Boston and that Deek was a naturalized U.S. citizen who, as Berger reminded President Clinton, had been in touch with extremists in the United States as well as abroad.    Before Ressam's arrest, Berger saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although the FBI put all field offices on alert.    Now, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps.    Both Berger andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before.    The next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the FBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks.    At a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC staff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U.S. cities, two Algerians detained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell.    The Justice Department released a statement on the alert the same day.    Clarke's staff warned, \"Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely.\"    Clarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert.\"    Is there a threat to civilian aircraft?\"he wrote.    Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report about a  Bin Laden plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights.    The CSG met daily.    Berger said that the principals met constantly.    Later, when asked what made her decide to ask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary inspection, testified that it was her \"training and experience.\"    It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in Ressam's detention.    There was a mounting sense of public alarm.    The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and Ressam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season.    The FBI was more communicative during the millennium crisis than it had ever been. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

Several of the younger children ran to her as she came in, and stood holding fast to the folds of her black habit, staring up at the strangers, while she explained the kind of instruction given, the system, and the order reigning in each department.     Finally, she persuaded a little girl, only six years old, to take her dusky face out of the long flowing veil of the nun, and show how quickly she could read a sentence that Sister Winifred wrote on the blackboard.     Then others were called on, and gave examples of their accomplishments in easy arithmetic and spelling.     The children must have been very much bored with themselves that stormy Sunday, for they entered into the examination with a quite unnatural zest.

The next morning he introduced himself to the Governor, was received as his guest, and remained in conference with him throughout the day.    What was the character of their communication is unknown, except by inference from its results.    When presented to Judge Eckels, on the following day, Mr. Kane exhibited to him the letters he bore from the President, and other letters, also, from Brigham Young, accrediting him as a negotiator in the existing difficulties.    To General Johnston he showed nothing; nor did the Governor, to the knowledge of the camp, acquaint either that officer or any other person with the purport of his business.    It was evident to everybody, however, that the Mormon leaders, conscious of their inability to resist the force by which they would be assailed so soon as the snow should melt upon the mountains, were engaged in an effort, of which Mr. Kane was the agent, to secure through the Governor, if possible, indemnity for their past offences, in consideration of acknowledgment of his authority. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

This force is called a magnetic force.    The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about.    You exert a force on a book when you lift it.    You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle.    In both those cases, those forces cause a change.    The change you see in both these cases is called motion.    Magnets, too, can produce change.    They can produce motion just like you do.    Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force.    A magnetic force is exerted over a distance.    Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them.    Thats how the maglev train works.    Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch?    These forces are known as non-contact forces.    Another type of non-contact force you may be familiar with is gravity.    Gravity too can cause changes in motion.    Gravity holds our moon in orbit without touching it. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge.    Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career.    Somewhere along the line, all of that changed.    Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982.    After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year.    The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice.    From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today.    Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about.    It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized.    The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October.    More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering.    One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work.    Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission.    The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice.    The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana.    \"This award came as a real surprise to me.    It is truly an honor.    Just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro bono process was somewhat humbling. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

The answers are important enough that they will be a discussion topic of this year's Senior Day at 9 a.m.    March 25 in the House Chamber at the Capitol.    The following is a preview of some of the answers for review: We can all agree that older Oklahomans need medical care.    But even the best care is worthless if an older patient can't drive to the doctor for ongoing treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt dispute.    Therefore, lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 Oklahomans age 60 and older.    Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment.    Lawyers know how to make landlords heat apartments so the medical treatment can stick.    (By the way, a May 16, 2001, article in The New York Times reports on a program at Boston Medical Center providing a walk-in legal clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients' legal and administrative battles.) We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.    \"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.    Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.    It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.    In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.    They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.    Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.    But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.    Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.    All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow.    His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon.    Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum.    While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov.    His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832.    Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes.    Pushkin had accused D'Anthes, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet's wife, Natalya Pushkina. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society.    The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat.    As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids.    of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation.    based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis.    civil justice.    The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: $11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association.    In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people.    Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor.    While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society.    Most memorably, he secured a $115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices.    His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue.    To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty.    In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients.    Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002.    The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.    National pro-bono participation is even worse.    Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: When Zarco first landed on the volcanic archipelago, had he landed on what he later named \"Madeira\"? \nContent: Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira's origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend.    Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato's lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America.    The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting.    Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth.    Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe.    Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon.    Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source.    After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo.    More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo.    If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around.    Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port).    The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo.    They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \"Island of Timber.    \" The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization.    Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go\u00advern\u00adors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk\u00a0\u2014\u00a0armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones\u00a0\u2014\u00a0attacked and captured the local French garrison.    It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olh\u00e3o all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection.    The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting.    The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence.    At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel.    The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers.    With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon.    Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that.    By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt.    The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown.    Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy.    On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe.    The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19.    Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910.    Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself.    Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years.    You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon.    In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society.    An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996.    While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East.    By a.d.    900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century.    In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \"Five Great Clans\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man.    First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today.    You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact.    Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities.    The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America.    As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians.    While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center.    Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

Matter is able to change forms despite, usually, not being in motion? \nContent: Simply put, energy is the ability to a cause change.    Energy can cause many types of change.    Think about when you have a lot of energy.    You are able to do a lot of things.    When you dont have a lot of energy, you may sit around and do very little.    A similar thing happens to particles of matter as energy is added.    The more energy there is, the faster the particles of matter move.    Energy is also the reason you are able to move around.    In fact, matter is always in motion.    It can even change from one form to another.    For example, electrical energy can be converted into heat energy.    You see this every time you use the toaster.    Energy causes a change in matter when you lift your arm.    Energy can be used to move matter.    You use energy to take a step to move forward.    Thanks to energy, your body moves.    The energy of moving matter is called kinetic energy. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

The soles of your shoes are much rougher than skates.    The rougher surface of shoes causes more friction and slows you down.    Heavier objects also have more friction.    A heavy object presses down with more force.    The surfaces are held together more tightly.    This makes the surfaces harder to slide past each other.

The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten.    Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders.    When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws.    Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread.    The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes.    But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can.    Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away.    He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers.    The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns.    The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread.    They yell at him when he walks on the table.    But Dillon does not listen.    The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat.

A flower may have to wait a long time for the right animals to come by.    What if one never passes close enough to the flower?    Hoping the wind will blow is also risky for a plant.    What if the wind does not blow?    What if the blowing pollen does not land on another flower?    The wind could even blow the pollen over the ocean where it is wasted.    Giving free nectar is costly.    It is not a good use of the plants energy.    A plant uses a lot of energy to produce nectar.    Some animals may just drink the nectar.    They may not carry off any pollen in return.    To improve their chances, plants evolved special traits.    For example, they developed ways to hide their nectar.    Only certain animals were able to get at the plants hidden nectar.    These specific animals might be more likely to visit only flowers of the same species.

Now _he_ was in charge, it was _his_ road from that hour on.    He crushed MacDonald's hand in a grip that meant more than words when they parted.    In his own cabin he threw off his coat and hat, lighted his pipe, and tried to realize just what this all meant for him.

{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Can oil reduce the amount of heat that is produced from the moving parts of a car? \nContent: You know that friction also causes heat.    Think about when you rub your hands together.    It is friction that makes them warm.    But why does this happen?    Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster.    Faster moving particles have more heat energy.    Heat from friction can be useful.    Can you think of other places where you might find friction?    Friction also lets you light a match.

It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert.    Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing.    Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult.    In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery.    To find out why required new technology.    It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet.    Seismograph are used to study earthquakes.    By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior.    They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core.    The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel.    Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here.    It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal.

It has many important functions.    The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body.    It prevents the loss of too much water from the body.    It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body.    The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature.    It keeps the body cool in two ways.    Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body.    Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen.    This action increases blood flow to the body surface.    This allows more heat to reach the surface.    The heat is then able to radiate off the body.    The opposite happens to retain body heat.    Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.    This decreases blood flow to the body surface.    This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface.    When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century.    They were peaceful and lived by \"slash-and-burn\" farming.    For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island.    They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving.    In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle.    The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them.    Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island.    They called Jamaica \"Xaymaca\" (\"land of wood and water\").    Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor.    He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba.    After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor.    Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island.    The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans.    A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish.    The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town.    Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers.

On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away.    You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here.    If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes.    In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills.    Why do you think this is?    What could have caused these features?    There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material.    The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it.    To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years.    Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States.    Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice.    Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice.

They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze.    Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings.    \"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\" Dempsey said.    \"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\"    Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless.    According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security.    A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment.    Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than $25,000.    \"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- $3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\" Dempsey said.    \"They're not looking to get rich off this.    A lot of this is simply because they were treated so badly.\"    Dempsey said most of the tenants who filed suits still live at the apartment complex, although many are trying to find homes elsewhere.    \"The new apartments (they were provided) were not in very good shape.

So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher.    You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north.    The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving.    Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state.    These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial.    If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque.    Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam.    Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle.    Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership.    Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University.    A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it.    One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \"good man\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden.    Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999.    Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry.    Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995.

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished.    On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, $6.5 million last year.    However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people.    \"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger.    \"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.    Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have.    Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid.\"    Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job.    When it was over, Iwasaki had $1 million more in federal dollars and two new offices.    Long Beach clients regained services they had lost years ago when federal budget cuts and dwindling grants reduced the staff of 15 lawyers to five and cut immigration and consumer law programs.    Iwasaki said, \"[I judged the transition] better than I could have hoped for.\" \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

The decision to release the prisoners follows \"numerous requests\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro.    Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record.    With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released.    Those who will be freed have already served a \"important\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate.    The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said.    Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy.    Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state.    He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet.    Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days.    He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \"generosity and strength of the revolution.\"    The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

I doubt if the best woman in Christendom would so reproach and abase herself, if convicted of even a worse sin than the secret use of those stimulants for which the \"charny\" is a Martial equivalent.     No Martialist would dream of poisoning his blood and besotting his brain with alcohol in any form.     But their opiates affect a race addicted to physical repose, to sensuous enjoyment rather than to sensual excitement, and to lucid intellectual contemplation, with a sense of serene delight as supremely delicious to their temperament as the dreamy illusions of haschisch to the Turk, the fierce frenzy of bhang to the Malay, or the wild excitement of brandy or Geneva to the races of Northern Europe.     But as with the luxury of intoxication in Europe, so in Mars indulgence in these drugs, freely permitted to the one sex, is strictly forbidden by opinion and domestic rule to the other.

In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies.    Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science.    Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution.    He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution.    He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV.    The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals.

In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981.    The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities.    His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized.    The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial.    Powell said his discussions with Mahathir \"touched on the case\" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Powell said the United States had \"always felt\" were flawed.    The assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, James Kelly, met on Tuesday morning with Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, for what she later told Malaysian reporters was a discussion about both the detention of her husband and six supporters, and the campaign against terrorism. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \"The ruling monarch of the mind.\"    Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.    Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.    Einstein next traveled to California where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan.    His friendship with Millikan was \"awkward\", as Millikan \"had a penchant for patriotic militarism,\" where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist.    During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.    This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism.    Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin.    They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner.    Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament,\" from which came his \"extraordinary intellectual energy.\"    Chaplin also remembers Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his theory of relativity.    During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food.    She asked him if something was bothering him.    He sat down at his piano and started playing.    He continued playing and writing notes for half an hour, then went upstairs to his study, where he remained for two weeks, with Elsa bringing up his food.    At the end of the two weeks he came downstairs with two sheets of paper bearing his theory.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend?    \"It feels just like it felt before,\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \"French Chef\" television series.    The show, along with her seminal book, \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats.    While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly.    First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded).    Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member.    Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion.    The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities.    When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home.

Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order.    He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President.    The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation.    On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary.    Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania.    Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization.    At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out.    Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \"engage or \"take out\" the aircraft.

It was forced up from the collision of two continents.    Fossils of plants are found in Antarctica.    Now, Antarctica is almost completely covered with ice.    Plants do not grow in Antarctica.    According to fossils, they once did.    This means that Antarctica was once much warmer than it is now.    These fossils tell us about Antarcticas past climate. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

His turtle's name was Tumble.    Tumble liked to walk around outside in the garden and dig small holes to sleep in.    Billy loved Tumble and would visit him outside when he got home from school.    Tumble's favorite food was oatmeal.    So, every day after school, Billy would make Tumble a big bowl of oatmeal and take it outside for Tumble to enjoy.    Tumble would see Billy and walk up to him as fast as a turtle can go.    Billy would put the bowl down and wait for Tumble to come up to the bowl to eat from it.    When Tumble reached the bowl, he put his nose on it.    But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat.    Billy reached down and blew on the hot oatmeal, to cool it down for Tumble to eat.    Once the oatmeal was cool enough, Tumble could dig in and eat his big bowl of oatmeal.    Billy loved to watch as Tumble ate his bowl of oatmeal, because Billy took good care of Tumble, everyday. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Do mountain streams create broad floodplains and meanders? \nContent: Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition.    Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion.    How water transports particles depends on their size.    When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment.    This process starts with the largest particles first.    Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain.    It picks up sediment.    Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water.    Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls.    Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders.    Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas.    Floodwaters may deposit natural levees.    Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes.    Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits.    They build up in caves as water continues to drip. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}
{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Will everyone have to pay a fine for beating a woman or a dog in Schuylkill County? \nContent: If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a $100 fine.    If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine.    In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea.    Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a $100 fine.    No defendants were ordered to pay more than a $250 fine for violating the court order.    In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty.    In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved.    Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal.    \"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\" Casey said.    \"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders?    That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\"    Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.    Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order.    Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases.    She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed.    West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state.    \"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\" West said.    \"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}
{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Was agriculture and forms early civilization available at any point in Las Vega's history? \nContent: The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c.    , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake.    During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline.    The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries.    The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated.    Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development.    Around 3000 b.c.    , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.    By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception\u2002\u2014\u2002the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas.    These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River.    The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife.    Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis.    For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization.    Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d.    , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley.    Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest.    This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society\u2002\u2014\u2002the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.    Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Does the nose trap dust and moisten the air? \nContent: Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs.    The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm.    This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs.    Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens.    This increases the size of the chest.    This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs.    This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs.    Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes.    This decreases the size of the chest.    This increases air pressure inside the lungs.    This action allows for air to leave the lungs.    When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place.    What happens to the air along the way?    In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air.    The air is also warmed and moistened.

He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine.    He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.    Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble.    Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander.    This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months.    Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy.    No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual.    Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\".    Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial.    Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life.    However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age.    Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions.    Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \"pleasures of the body\".    Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her.

Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA.    HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country.    Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville.    But the garden serves an even greater purpose.    The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood.    \"It's a reawakening going on.    It's almost like it's a renaissance,\" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. \"There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa.    Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward.    Even if you look at coming over here during our enslavement, we were brought here to cultivate the land because that's something we did on the continent.    So really, that's what many of the people are doing now,\" he said.

{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Were the key players in the 9/11 conspiracy who executed the plane operations established al Qaeda members? \nContent: Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative.    The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany.    Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy.    Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney.    After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years.    In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany.    They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially.    After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992.    He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family.    After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999.    He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan.    In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language.    When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so.    This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced.    According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg.    In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians.    Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality.    But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center.

Then, placing himself at their head, he gave the word, and charged down the street upon the Roundheads.    The latter, occupied by their attack upon the houses, were unconscious of the presence of their foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise.    The force of the charge was irresistible, and the Roundheads, dispersed and on foot, were cut down in all directions.    Groups of twos and threes stood together and attempted resistance, but the main body thought only of regaining their horses.    In three minutes after the Royalists entered the village the surviving Roundheads were in full flight, hotly pursued by the victorious Cavaliers.    These, being for the most part better mounted, overtook and slew many of the Roundheads, and not more than half the force which had set out returned to their quarters at Didcot.    The pursuit continued to within half a mile of that place, and then Harry, knowing that there was a force of Roundhead infantry there, drew off from the pursuit, and returned to Chalcombe.    He found that more than half of Sir Ralph Willoughy's men had been killed, many having been cut down before they could betake themselves to their arms, those quartered in the inn, and at two or three of the larger houses, having alone maintained a successful resistance until the arrival of succor. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

They included the collapse of the Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U.S.\" spy plane\" brought down in Chinese territory.    The new administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf.    In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically.    In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded.    These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda.    Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat.    The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad.    Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI.    Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\"    In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness.    The next few months were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the Sixth Fleet back to Washington to manage it.    The Vice President's task force was just getting under way when the 9/11 attack occurred. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry.    The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.    Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates.    He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field.    This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.    The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrodinger and others. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime.    In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet.    In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour.    There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye.    Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel.    The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk.    Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov.    The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences.    A minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after him.    A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour.

Two quintessential novellas, \"The Lust of the White Serpant\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal.    While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it.    Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband.    But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \"Pagoda\".    Whalen Lai notes, \"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man.

Her dangerous sexuality is the key.    Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre.

In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable.    Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks.    In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS).    John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president.    Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates.    Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York.    In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina.    He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument.    Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves.    Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries.    In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France.

The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one.    It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north.    Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces.    The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses.    And beaches.    Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters.    With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations.    The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel.    Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year\u00a0\u2014\u00a0more than almost any other international resort area.    The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields.    In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away.    Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations.    Superb golf facilities abound\u00a0\u2014\u00a0several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular.    Sports, beaches and hospitable weather\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not to mention easily organized package vacations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety.    But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here.    The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east.    West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms.    Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513.    His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca.    1496).    These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.    It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman.    However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.    Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block.    Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}

In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before.    Orion comes loaded with superlatives.    It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles.    It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made.    No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions.    Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.    Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module.    \"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement.    A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base.    At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction.    The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage.    Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery.    Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket.    For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. \nAnswer:", "output": "no"}
{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Do some plants' leaves fall off in the winter months? \nContent: Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness.    Do you know how plants respond to these changes?    Some plants open their leaves during the day.    It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight.    At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss.    Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day.    As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant.    Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth.    It does this in order to survive.    Shorter days signal the coming of winter.    Winter in most areas means extreme cold.    It is also very dry in the winter months.    As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color.    After the change in color, they fall off.    This dormancy period helps trees.    It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter.    Plants only want to grow when conditions are right. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}

The first man in the line was already at the railing, and the questions put to him by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney and a court attendant.    His muttered answers were in turn repeated to the judge.    \"Says he's married, naturalized citizen, Lutheran Church, die- cutter by profession.\" The probation officer, her hands filled with papers, bustled forward and whispered.    \"Mrs. Austin says,\" continued the district attorney, \"she's looked into this case, and asks to have the man turned over to her.

{"input": "Please answer the question according to the contents just with yes or no.\nQuestion: Are there other examples of static discharge? \nContent: You may wonder if there are other examples of static discharge.    The answer is yes.    Lightning is a form of static discharge.    It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle.    You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation.    You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm.    What does lighting have to do with static electricity?    As it turns out, everything!    During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges.    This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles.    The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds.    The positive charges are concentrated at the top.    The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below.    The ground then becomes positively charged.    Over time the differences increase.    Eventually the electrons are discharged.    This is what we see as lightning.    You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below. \nAnswer:", "output": "yes"}
